PU Rendering Process:
---------------------

1) Task Division:

The rendering task is divided into smaller sub-tasks that can be processed in parallel. For example, an image might be divided into smaller tiles or chunks.

2) Vertex Processing:

Vertices of 3D models are transformed into 2D coordinates using vertex shaders. This involves computations like translations, rotations, and scaling.

3) Rasterization:

The transformed vertices are converted into pixels. This step determines which pixels correspond to which parts of the 3D models.

4) Pixel Shading:

Each pixel is shaded based on lighting, textures, and other effects. Pixel shaders calculate the color and brightness of each pixel.

5) Image Composition:

The final image is composed by combining all the processed pixels. This image is then displayed on the screen.
